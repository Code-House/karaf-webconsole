The base idea is to take the current felix webconsole (we use in Karaf), base it
on wicket and handle the entire thing on pax-wicket. Based on this method it should
be very simple to provide an VERY configurable and extendable webconsole which should
be much easier to write than the current one based on plain jscript and servlets.

This version uses the current snapshot of the OPS4J Pax Wicket Project. Although snapshots
are avialable via Sonatype please make sure that you've the latest build of Pax Wicket master
in your local .m2 repositories:

git clone git://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.wicket
cd org.ops4j.pax.wicket
mvn install

Now you can install the karaf-webconsole:

mvn install

The Karaf Webconsole includes a feature file you can use to run the project in the latest
Apache Karaf:

features:addurl mvn:org.apache.karaf.webconsole/features/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
